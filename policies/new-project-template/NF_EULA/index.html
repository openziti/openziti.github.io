expense, either (a) procure for Customer the right to continue exercising the rights licensed to Customer in this
Agreement; (b) replace or modify the Software so that it becomes non-infringing and remains functionally equivalent;
or (c) terminate all rights and licenses granted to Customer under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
NetFoundry will have no obligation under this Section or otherwise with respect to any infringement claim based upon
(i) any use of the Software that is not in accordance with NetFoundry&#x27;s documentation or this Agreement; (ii) any
use of the Software in combination with other products, equipment, software, or data not supplied by NetFoundry if
such infringement would not have arisen but for such combination; (iii) any use of any release of the Software other
than the most current release made available to Customer; or (iv) any modification or alteration of the Software by

third party claims that the Software infringes that third party&#x27;s intellectual property rights, NetFoundry, not
Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual
property infringement claim. This Section states NetFoundry&#x27;s entire liability and Customer&#x27;s sole and

NetFoundry promptly in writing of such action, giving NetFoundry sole control of the defense thereof and any related
settlement negotiations, and cooperating and, at NetFoundry&#x27;s reasonable request and expense, assisting in such
defense. Customer will, at its own expense, defend and indemnify NetFoundry and its affiliates against any damages,
