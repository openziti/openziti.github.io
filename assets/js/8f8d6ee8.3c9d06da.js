sort of network, it is simple to only allow the inbound traffic to ssh or other management and administrative ports to a few devices, in our case, the Edge Router serving the services described here

response functions only when driven by an incident, and requested by the responsible incident commander.\xa0\xa0 The logging and other features of the systems provide additional reviewability,
