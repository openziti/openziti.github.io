This is somewhat of a unique situation as it's specific to 64-bit atomic operations in Golang.

On arm, and other 32-bit architectures, this is 32 bits, so the processing word size will be 4 bytes. My guess as to the root of this problem lies in the nature of atomic operations. When memory addresses for data are properly aligned, it should only take one cycle to read the data, if it is misaligned, then it would take more than one cycle and, thus, likely cannot guarantee atomicity.
