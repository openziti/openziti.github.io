A Root CA can sign certificates that are themselves CAs as well. Those certificates represent Intermediate CAs. Layers of CAs starting with a root and adding intermediates along the way allows the private key for the Root CAs to be kept in a highly secure environment, which is not convenient to use for signing. This security means that the Root CA has a far less likely chance of having its private key compromised. Intermediate CAs are put into less secure environments and, if compromised, can be revoked.
