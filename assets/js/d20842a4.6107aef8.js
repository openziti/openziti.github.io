This seems useless from a data privacy standpoint, but it does something else that is vitally important. Any data decrypted by the public key must have been encrypted with the private key. This means we know who sent the data with a high degree of certainty. This is the basis of "signing data."

Changing even one bit in the data means will generate a different hash. Hashing allows us to deterministically generate fingerprints that are smaller than the original data. The algorithm to sign data is to hash the data into a fingerprint and then encrypt the fingerprint with a private key to generate a signature. To verify a signature, the verifier hashes the data into a fingerprint. That fingerprint is compared to the value of the decrypted signature.
